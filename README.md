# RedGingger Tasks
A minimal Todo App.

This flutter application is a very minimal todo app I made for flutter create contest. I have given this app a name called 'RedGingger Tasks' and the logo is also designed by me. This is just to create a brand identity nothing else.
With this app one can keep track of the works he/she need to do, Add & Delete tasks. The UI/UX is minimal and simple and it itself shows that lots of new things can be added in this app and it can be a super usefull app.
Its intresting an inspiring that one can keep track of all of its work with an app having code source of size less than 5kb with such a beautiful minimal design and exprience.

### How to run
To run this app you just need to use 'flutter run' command.
